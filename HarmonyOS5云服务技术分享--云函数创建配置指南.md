### Hello everyone! Today, let's explore how to create and configure functions in Huawei HarmonyOS' AGC cloud function service, and teach you step-by-step how to use HTTP triggers to master cloud functions. Whether you're a beginner or looking to optimize existing features, this guide will provide you with clear instructions. Let's dive right in! 👇  


### 🌟 I. What Can Cloud Functions Do?  
Cloud functions are like your "cloud assistant," allowing you to run code without managing servers. They're suitable for handling immediate tasks (such as automatically sending emails after users submit forms), data cleaning, or integrating with third-party APIs. HarmonyOS' AGC platform offers flexible configuration, supports multiple languages like Node.js, Python, and Java, and even allows custom runtime environments!  


### 🛠️ II. Hands-On: Create Your First Cloud Function  
#### Step 1: Access the Cloud Function Console  
1. Log in to the AGC console and select your project.  
2. Find **Cloud Development > Cloud Functions** in the left navigation bar and click **Create Function**.  

#### Step 2: Configure Basic Information  
- **Function Name**: Choose a cool name! Note that only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens are allowed, e.g., `my-first-function`.  
- **Trigger Type**: Select **Event Invocation** to use HTTP triggers (associated during subsequent configuration).  
- **Memory Size**: Choose from 500MB to 4GB; larger memory is recommended for processing images or videos.  
- **Runtime Environment**: Supports Node.js 14/18, Python 3, Java 1.8—pick your preferred language.  

#### Step 3: Write Function Code  
- **Online Editing** (suitable for simple code): Write directly in WebIDE with syntax highlighting and auto-completion.  
  ```javascript  
  // Node.js example: Return "Hello World!"  
  exports.handler = async (event) => {  
    return { statusCode: 200, body: "Hello World!" };  
  };  
  ```  
- **Upload ZIP Package** (suitable for complex projects): Java and custom environments must use ZIP; ensure the entry file is in the root directory.  

#### Step 4: Set Function Entry  
Format: `filename.methodname`, e.g., `index.handler` for Node.js.  
For Java users: The entry format is `packageName.className::methodName`, e.g., `com.example.Hello::handleRequest`.  


### ⚙️ III. Advanced Configuration: Empower Your Function  
#### 1. Environment Variables: Secure Sensitive Information  
Add database passwords, API keys, etc., in **Configuration > Environment Variables**.  
Two editing modes:  
- **Form Mode**: Directly fill in Key-Value, e.g., `DB_PASSWORD=123456`.  
- **JSON Mode**: Batch import, e.g., `{ "KEY1": "value1", "KEY2": "value2" }`.  

#### 2. Traffic Governance: Prevent Service Crashes  
- **Load Balancing**: Select **Response Time Weight** to prioritize requests to the fastest instances.  
- **Retry Policy**: Enable **jittered** policy for network fluctuations, automatically retrying at exponential intervals (up to 9 retries).  
- **Circuit Breaker**: Set to pause requests for 1 minute when the error rate exceeds 50% within 10 seconds to avoid cascading failures.  

#### 3. Version Management: One-Click Rollback  
- The system automatically generates snapshots when publishing new versions.  
- Need to roll back? Directly switch to historical versions in the **Versions** list—super stable!  


### 🚀 IV. Hands-On: Invoke Functions with HTTP Triggers  
1. After creating the function, bind an HTTP trigger on the **Triggers** page.  
2. Obtain the system-generated URL and send GET/POST requests using Postman or frontend code.  
3. Test the return result; if timeout occurs (default 55 seconds), adjust the timeout period in **Basic Configuration**.  


### 💡 V. Pitfall Prevention Guide  
- **ZIP Package Upload Failure**: Check the file structure! Node.js/Python entry files must be in the root directory, and Java package paths must match the code.  
- **Memory Insufficient Error**: When processing large files, choose 4GB memory for better stability.  
- **Environment Variables Not Taking Effect**: Remember to click **Save** after modifications and wait 10 seconds for configurations to take effect.
